__builtin_popcount(unsigned int) returns the number of set bits (__builtin_popcount(0b0001'0010'1100) == 4)
__builtin_ffs(int) finds the index of the first (most right) set bit (__builtin_ffs(0b0001'0010'1100) == 3)
__builtin_clz(unsigned int) the count of leading zeros (__builtin_clz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 23)
__builtin_ctz(unsigned int) the count of trailing zeros (__builtin_ctz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 2)
__builtin_parity(x) the parity (even or odd) of the number of ones in the bit representation

Note that some of the operations (both the C++20 functions and the Compiler Built-in ones) might be quite slow in GCC 
if you don't enable a specific compiler target with #pragma GCC target("popcnt").
